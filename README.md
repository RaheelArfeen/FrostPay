## Purpose

The purpose of Forst Pay is to simulate a real-world online bill payment system. Users can log in, view their pending bills (such as electricity, gas, water, or internet), and pay directly from their available balance. It demonstrates full-stack development skills including authentication, state management, UI design, and data handling using Firebase Firestore.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication** using Firebase (sign up, log in, and protected routes)
- **View Bills**: Users can view a list of utility bills with details like amount, due date, and status.
- **Pay Bills**: Users can pay any unpaid bill using their balance.
- **Balance Management**: Users can track how much balance is available before and after payments.
- **Winter-Themed UI**: Clean, frosty design with cool colors and interactive hover effects.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout suitable for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Client-side Routing** with protected and public routes.
- **Smooth UI Interactions** using animations and stylish components.
